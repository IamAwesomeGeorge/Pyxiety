## Code
The main.py acts as a menu for taking your pulse or playing game.

When you are taking your pulse, the sensor will take the measurement and display it on screen every second.

When you choose games, you can pick to play either of the following games:
- Paint
- Snake
- Blackjack
- Number Guesser

Each game is triggered by the menu as each game is stored on it's own python script file.
